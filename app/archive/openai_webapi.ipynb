Improved access to healthcare services, better disease prevention, and medical treatments have helped reduce mortality rates and increase life expectancy. Secondly, there has been a greater emphasis on public health initiatives such as vaccination programs, improved sanitation, and education about healthy lifestyles. These efforts have effectively reduced the spread of diseases and improved overall health outcomes. Additionally, there has been a decline in poverty rates globally, leading to better living conditions, nutrition, and overall well-being. Furthermore, advancements in knowledge and understanding of diseases, as well as increased research and development, have resulted in better disease management and treatment options. Lastly, lifestyle changes, such as reduced smoking rates and increased awareness about the importance of exercise and nutrition, have also contributed to the increase in life expectancy. Overall, the combination of improved healthcare, public health initiatives, reduced poverty, medical advancements, and healthier lifestyles has led to the significant increase in life expectancy worldwide from 2000 to 2020.\n"
