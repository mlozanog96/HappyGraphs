### Life Expectancy
intro_text = """
Increasing life expectancy is often regarded as a measure of societal progress. It reflects advancements in public health, education, technology, and social development. It indicates that societies are investing in improving the well-being of their citizens and addressing societal challenges.

Below you see a line graph showcasing how life expectancy has been increasing for many years worldwide. Increasing life expectancy makes us optimistic that the world is better off than we might sometimes think. Therefore, we invite you to explore more charts to make us happy.

Sidenote: Please don't get fooled by the decline of life expectancy since 2019. Research suggests that this is due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has induced the first decline in global life expectancy since World War II. For further information, please read the [Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01450-3).
